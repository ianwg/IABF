<p>Susan walks in the forest alone with her bloody dagger. She meets a blonde with
heavy makeup under a tree. The blonde looks drunk. Susan does not like her and
wants to walk away, but the blonde stops her."Are you having a date tonight?
It is a magical night! I am waiting for my love, what about you?" </p>
