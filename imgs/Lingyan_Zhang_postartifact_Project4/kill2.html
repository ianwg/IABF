<p>Susan keeps walking. Her dagger gradually absorbs the blood on it and turns
into red. But she does not notice it. She feels a bit cold, but she is not fear
about anything now. "What a dangerous girl!" There comes a voice above. It is a witch
sitting on the broom flying, "You must be grand daughter of that old lady. If you
want to find her, I might help you, with just a little cost." </p>

the witch by throwing her dagger towards her.</a>
