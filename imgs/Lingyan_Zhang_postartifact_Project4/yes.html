<p>Susan walks pass the carpenter boy, ignoring his begging, and
walks into the forest. The forest looks creepier than any other day.
Soon she walks pass the lake and finds a huge mushroom washing its face.
The mushroom realizes her and says:"It's a nice night isn't it? The enchanted
forest is shining."</p>

<a href="step.html">Susan walks towards the mushroom and steps him to the ground.
"I have nothing to say to a enchanted mushroom.
I know you are an asshole and I just want to find my grandma." </a>

  Do you prefer to be baked or just be raw?" </a>
